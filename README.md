# Translation-Service-with-LLM-STT-TTS
The guided project takes you through building a translation assistant that can take voice input, convert it to text using speech-to-text technology, send the text to Watsonx's mistralai/mistral-large, receive a response in other languages, convert it to speech using text-to-speech technology and finally play it back to the user.


## Step 1: Understanding the interface
  In this project, the goal is to create an interface that allows communication with a voice assistant, and a backend to manage the sending and receiving of responses.
  Set up the environment by executing the following code:
    'python3.11 -m venv my_env
     source my_env/bin/activate # activate my_env'
  Run the following commands in the terminal to receive the outline of the project, rename it with another name and finally move into that directory:
    'git clone https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/translator-with-voice-and-watsonx
     cd translator-with-voice-and-watsonx'
  Installing the requirements for the project:
     'pip install -r requirements.txt'

## Step 2: Understanding the server
  The server is how the application will run and communicate with all our services.

## Step 3: Integrating Watsonx API
## Step 4: Integrating Watson Speech-to-Text
## Step 5: Integrating Watson Text-to-Speech
## Step 6: Putting everything together by creating Flask API endpoints
