# Translation-Service-with-LLM-STT-TTS
The guided project takes you through building a translation assistant that can take voice input, convert it to text using speech-to-text technology, send the text to Watsonx's mistralai/mistral-large, receive a response in other languages, convert it to speech using text-to-speech technology and finally play it back to the user.
